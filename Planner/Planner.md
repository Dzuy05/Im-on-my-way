# MY STUDY PLANNER FOR MY UNI-VERSE

* What i gonna study:
    * [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)üêç.
    * The follow this [Python roadmapüêç](https://roadmap.sh/python) for further study.
* **PLSS MASTER PYTHON OR YOU'RE SUCK**

## Chemistry üß™
* What i should concentrate on:
    * Atom and elements
    * Chemical compounds
    * Volume of reactant and product
    * Chemical reactions
    * Electronic structure
    * Covalent bond
    * Molecular struture
    * Solid
    * Liquid fuels and polymeric compounds 
    * Reaction rate
    * Chemical balance 
    * Acid and bases
    * Thermodynamics
    * Electrochemical
* Bcuz i don't have the textbook of my subject so we can study through [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLidqqIGKox7WeOKVGHxcd69kKqtwrKl8W) first.

## C ¬©
